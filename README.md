# Pihole-Activity
A Python project that manages an LED bar graph and two activity LED on a Raspberry Pi
## Getting Started
This project’s goal is to enclose a pi-hole server in a project box with added activity lights in the front panel. This project requires a raspberry pi with pi-hole already setup on it.

### For the final build

| Description | Link | Quantity | Price |
| ----------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 10 segments red LED Bar Graph | [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32811943871.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.385757df1b2Lr8&algo_pvid=81b6ea2e-bbe1-4634-9305-ca7d9543ac35&algo_expid=81b6ea2e-bbe1-4634-9305-ca7d9543ac35-16&btsid=0844ca98-45f0-41d7-bb55-1833f7978391&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_7,searchweb201603_55) | 1 | $0.88 |
| Red LED | | 1 | |
| Green LED | | 1 | |
| 220Ω resistor | | 12 | |
| Single Row Right Angle Pin Header | | 11 | |
| Single Row Pin Header | | 3 | |
| Female to Female Jumper wires<sup>1</sup> | | 14 | |
| PerfBoard | | 1 | |
| 115x80x40 Project Box<sup>2</sup> | | 1 | |

<sup>1</sup>Ideally look for jumper cable in ribbon style so you can keep bundles together for each circuit.
<sup>2</sup>The size provided is based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W with an ethernet to micro USB adapter. I suggest you draw everything to size and make sure everything fits before commiting to a project box size.
### For prototyping
If it's not your first Raspberry Pi project, you should have most of these item. They will not be permanent to the build and will be reusable afterward.

| Description | Link | Quantity | Price |
| ----------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| Male-to-Male Jumper wires |  | 16 |  |
| BreadBoard |  | 1 |  |
| Raspberry Pi GPIO Extender Shield<sup>1</sup> |  | 1 |  |
| BreadBoard power supply<sup>1</sup> |  | 1 |  |

<sup>These two elements are optional, but helps a lot in the prototyping phase.</sup>
### General Equipment
This list of item are purely equipment that will be need to do the build like I did. You can use any other methods of your likng to get to the same result.
- Soldering Iron
- Solde
- Flux
- Helping hand
- Electric drill
- Exacto
- Hot Glue Gun
### Raspberry Pi equipment
This is the Raspberry Pi that was used for my build. Any other Raspberry Pi could work for the build, but the size and way the wiring was made is based on this form factor.
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Ethernet to micro USB adapter
- 5v 2.5a micro USB power supply
- 32 Gb micro SD card
