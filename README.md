# Pihole-Activity
A Python project that manages an LED bar graph and two activity LED on a Raspberry Pi
## Getting Started
This project’s goal is to enclose a pi-hole server in a project box with added activity lights in the front panel. This project requires a raspberry pi with pi-hole already setup on it.
